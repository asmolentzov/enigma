# Enigma Project
### Anna Smolentzov Self Evaluation

1. Functionality
  - 3
  - Enigma class with encrypt and decrypt methods implemented per spec. Runner files with CLI's implemented per spec. 
  - Planning on implementing crack method and runner file as next steps.
2. Object Oriented Programming
  - 3-4
  - 6 Classes: Enigma, Codebook, Shift, Key, Offset, Rotator. None over 100 lines.
  - 1 Module: RandomNumber.
  - I don't believe any methods are over 8 lines of code, at least reek isn't saying so. 
  - The only lines of code that are over 80 characters are in runner files, where they specify the output to the screen.
  - Codebook class uses class methods. 
  - As far as I can tell, method and variable names clearly communicate purpose.
3. Test Driven Development
  - 3-4
  - Every method is tested. 
  - Tests were written before writing code, this should be clear from git history.
  - Test coverage metrics at 100%
  - Did NOT implement tests for CLI/runner files, per spec. Tested them manually which was successful.
  - Codebook test uses mocks and stubs in order to not have to create Shift objects. 
4. Version Control
  - 3
  - 19 Pull Requests, 120 commits
  - Commits were done in very small pieces of functionality.
  - Pull Requests included description of the functionality they added.
